Dear new tenant,

Welcome! From time to time, you might have unexpected visitors at your door.
Here are a few tips to keep in mind:

* *Don't sign anything at the door.*
* *Don't let strangers into your home.*
* *Be cautious and don't share more information than necessary.* +
  Even saying _"Yes, my name is ..."_ can be too much for someone who hasn't +
  contacted you formally.

== Common Scams and Dubious Practices

* *Telekom:*
  They may claim they can improve your Internet. See the details below.
* *Jehovah's Witnesses / Zeugen Jehovas*
* *Bofrost / Eismann / ... :*
  These are frozen food delivery services that existed long before today's startups.
  If you're interested, check out their websites instead of engaging at the door.

== Improving Your Internet Performance

* *WiFi/WLAN Issues:*
  Many problems can be related to your WiFi setup.
  See the tips below.
* *Contact Your Provider:*
  If you have issues, contact your current Internet service provider first.
  If they canâ€™t resolve the problem, consider switching to a different one.
* *Understanding Telekom:*
  While Telekom built much of Germany's network infrastructure, they must allow competitors to use it.
  Good Internet isn't just about high speeds or fiber optics.
  One issue with Telekom is their refusal to peer at DE-CIX, which can affect your service.

== Enhancing Your WiFi Performance

* *Channel Width:*
  Set to 20 MHz for 2.4 GHz and 40 or 80 MHz for 5 GHz radios.
* *Channel Selection:*
  For 2.4 GHz, choose from channels 1, 6, and 11.
* *Device Use:*
  Prefer 5 GHz for devices that support it, or even better, use a cable connection.

== Handling Persistent Talkers

Don't feel guilty or pressured to make a quick decision.
Always take the time you need to think things over.
You can end any conversation with a genuine businessperson at any time.

Stay safe and enjoy your new home!
